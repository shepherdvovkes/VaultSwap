CTO Meeting: Project Feedback & Discussion Points
1. Cross-Platform Compatibility
The project has primarily been developed and tested on Linux. Could you share your perspective on
what adjustments might be needed for smooth builds and usability on macOS and Windows?
If possible, any observations from attempting to build or run the project on macOS/Windows would
be very useful for planning next steps.
2. Project Timeline Feasibility
In your preliminary analysis, you mentioned that 6 months might be tight. Could you outline which
parts of the project are most time-sensitive or could pose risks to meeting that timeline?
3. Architecture & Scalability
- Based on the current codebase and design, do you see any potential limitations in scaling the
system?
- Are there any critical architectural improvements you would recommend before full development
begins?
4. Integration & Dependencies
- Are there external libraries, APIs, or dependencies that could cause integration challenges across
different environments?
- Any suggestions for mitigating those risks upfront?
5. Performance Considerations
- Are there specific components that may require optimization early on?
- Any recommendations for benchmarks or testing to ensure reliable performance?
6. Security & Data Handling
- Do you see any security concerns with the current design that should be addressed before
production?
- Are there platform-specific security issues we should anticipate?
7. Technical Ownership & Collaboration
- Do you foresee any parts of the project that might need more hands-on technical guidance?
- What information or resources would be helpful from our team to support your leadership as tech
lead?
8. Build & Deployment
- Any insights on CI/CD setup for multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)?
- Are there deployment challenges we should anticipate for production-ready builds?
9. Future Enhancements
- Are there features or improvements you would recommend prioritizing in the first phase versus
later phases?
