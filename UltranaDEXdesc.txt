Our platform encompasses key functionalities such as pooling, liquidity provision, 
staking (farming), and trading. We are in the process of developing a decentralized 
exchange (DEX) platform for traders within the EVM network, with plans to integrate 
an Automated Market Maker (AMM) mechanism.
We also need to implement the mobile design.

There are several modifications required to align the platform with our evolving vision. 

An important aspect to consider is the animation on the landing page. This is crucial because 
the landing page is the first thing users see when they visit the site. While there is
 currently an animation, feedback from visual experts and developers suggests that it would be
  better to remove it. The animation is too tiring on the eyes, and removing it could 
  improve the overall user experience by creating a cleaner design.
